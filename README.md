What is version control: Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Difference between git and Github: Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. 

Some alternatives to GitHub:
GitLab: A free, open-source DevOps tool with a user-friendly interface, security features, and private repositories. 
Bitbucket: Integrates well with the Atlassian ecosystem and offers code review. 
Azure DevOps: A comprehensive suite of development tools with Microsoft integration. 
AWS CodeCommit: A fully managed source control service from Amazon Web Services that supports collaborative software development. 
Radicle: A sovereign code infrastructure that enables developers to collaborate on software over a peer-to-peer network. 
Kiln: A code management software based on the Mercurial version control language that supports Git. Kiln is part of the FogBugz DevHub platform, which also includes bug tracking and project management tools. 
Codegiant: An all-in-one development platform that aims to simplify the development lifecycle. 
Gogs: A self-hosted Git service. 

Difference between Git fetch and pull. The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.

git rebase: is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. The command for rebasing in Git is git rebase.

Cherry-picking in Git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another.The command for git cherry pick is git cherry-pick
